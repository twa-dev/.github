# Welcome to the community of Telegram Web Apps developers!
The goal of this organization is to share experiences between Telegram Web Apps (TWA) developers. We already have done a lot of work
and we would like to share it with you.

## Tools
Telegram [provides a rich SDK](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) for TWA developers.
During the TWA development process, we realized that some parts of our code deserve to be shared.
These parts work alongside Telegram SDK. They complete it.

### [@twa-dev/types](https://github.com/twa-dev/types)
Types for TWA SDK.

### [@twa-dev/SDK](https://github.com/twa-dev/SDK)
NPM package for TWA SDK.

### [@twa-dev/Mark42](https://github.com/twa-dev/Mark42)
Simple lightweight tree-shakable UI library for TWA.

## Boilerplates

### [@twa-dev/vanilla-js-boilerplate](https://github.com/twa-dev/vanilla-js-boilerplate)
Basic and straightforward boilerplate based on simple web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project aims to provide a minimalistic example of how to create a simple TWA and launch it within Telegram without relying on complex build tools or bleeding-edge libraries.

### [@twa-dev/webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/twa-dev/webpack-boilerplate)
Webpack-based modern boilerplate featuring:
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules
- Traffic tunneling with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- Static analyze
- Bundle analyze

### [@twa-dev/vite-boilerplate](https://github.com/twa-dev/vite-boilerplate)
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern frontend tool that offers several advantages over traditional build tools, including faster development times, smaller bundle sizes, and improved developer experience. It supports React, Vue, Svelte and many more. This example based on:
- React
- TypeScript
- Deploy with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages
## Design
### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@firststagelabs)
Design component library in Figma, which will make it easier for designers to design apps for TWA. The components fully mimic the Telegram interface, use it as a foundation, and inherit all existing principles. Libraries are available for iOS and Android. Moreover, these same components are reused for designing the [@wallet](https://walletbot.org/). Please note that the libraries are in beta status, so bugs are possible.

## Communication
If you have any questions or suggestions about the particular tool, you are welcome to create an Issue or Pull
Request.
