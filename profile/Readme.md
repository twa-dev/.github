# Welcome to the community of Telegram Web Apps developers!
The goal of this organization is to share experiences between Telegram Web Apps (TWA) developers. We already have done a lot of work
and we would like to share it with you.

## Tools
Telegram [provides a rich SDK](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) for TWA developers.
During the TWA development process, we realized that some parts of our code deserve to be shared.
These parts work alongside Telegram SDK. They complete it.

### [@twa-dev/types](https://github.com/twa-dev/types)
Types for TWA SDK.

### [@twa-dev/SDK](https://github.com/twa-dev/SDK)
NPM package for TWA SDK.

### [@twa-dev/Mark42](https://github.com/twa-dev/Mark42)
Simple lightweight tree-shakable UI library for TWA.

### [@twa-dev/Boilerplate](https://github.com/twa-dev/Boilerplate)
Liberal Create React App for TWA enthusiasts.

## Design
### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@firststagelabs)
Design component library in Figma, which will make it easier for designers to design apps for TWA. The components fully mimic the Telegram interface, use it as a foundation, and inherit all existing principles. Libraries are available for iOS and Android. Moreover, these same components are reused for designing the [@wallet](https://walletbot.org/). Please note that the libraries are in beta status, so bugs are possible.

## Communication
If you have any questions or suggestions about the particular tool, you are welcome to create an Issue or Pull
Request.
