# Welcome to the community of Telegram Web Apps developers!
The goal of this organization is to share experiences between Telegram Web Apps (TWA) developers. We already have done a lot of work
and we would like to share it with you.

## Tools
Telegram [provides a rich SDK](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) for TWA developers.
During the TWA development process, we realized that some parts of our code deserve to be shared.
These parts work alongside Telegram SDK. They complete it.
